er lives almost by his looks and for myself, my virtue or my plague, be it either which, shes so conjunctive to my life and soul, that, as the star moves not but in his sphere, i could not but by her. the other motive, why to a public count i might not go, is the great love the general gender bear him, who, dipping all his faults in their affection, would like the spring that turneth wood to stone, convert his gyves to graces so that my arrows, too slightly timberd for so loud a wind, would have reverted to my bow again, and not where i had aimd them. laertes. and so have i a noble father lost, a sister driven into desperate terms, whose worth, if praises may go back again, stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections. but my revenge will come. king. break not your sleeps for that. you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger, and think it pastime. you shortly shall hear more. i lovd your father, and we love ourself, and that, i hope, will teach you to imagine enter a messenger. how now? what news? messenger. letters, my lord, from hamlet. this to your majesty this to the queen. king. from hamlet! who brought them? messenger. sailors, my lord, they say i saw them not. they were given me by claudio. he receivd them of him that brought them. king. laertes, you shall hear them. leave us.   high and mighty, you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom. tomorrow shall i beg leave to see your kingly eyes. when i shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my sudden and more strange return. hamlet. what should this mean? are all the rest come back? or is it some abuse, and no such thing? laertes. know you the hand? king. tis hamlets character. naked! and in a postscript here he says alone. can you advise me? laertes. i am lost in it, my lord. but let him come, it warms the very sickness in my heart that i shall live and tell him to his teeth, thus diest thou. king. if it be so, laertes, as how should it be so? how otherwise? will you be ruld by me? laertes. ay, my lord so you will not oerrule me to a peace. king. to thine own peace. if he be now returnd, as checking at his voyage, and that he means no more to undertake it, i will work him to an exploit, now ripe in my device, under the which he shall not choose but fall and for his death no wind shall breathe, but even his mother shall uncharge the practice and call it accident. laertes. my lord, i will be ruld the rather if you could devise it so that i might be the organ. king. it falls right. you have been talkd of since your travel much, and that in hamlets hearing, for a quality wherein they say you shine. your sum of parts did not together pluck such envy from him as did that one, and that, in my regard, of the unworthiest siege. laertes. what part is that, my lord? king. a very riband in the cap of youth, yet needful too, for youth no less becomes the light and careless livery that it wears than settled age his sables and his weeds, importing health and graveness. two months since here was a gentleman of normandy, ive seen myself, and servd against, the french, and they can well on horseback, but this gallant had witchcraft int. he grew unto his seat, and to such wondrous doing brought his horse, as had he been incorpsd and deminaturd with the brave beast. so far he toppd my thought that i in forgery of shapes and tricks, come short of what he did. laertes. a norman wast? king. a norman. laertes. upon my life, lamord. king. the very same. laertes. i know him well. he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation. king. he made confession of you, and gave you such a masterly report for art and exercise in your defence, and for your rapier most especially, that he cried out twould be a sight indeed if one could match you. the scrimers of their nation he swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye, if you opposd them. sir, this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming oer to play with him. now, out of this, laertes. what out of this, my lord? king. laertes, was your father dear to you? or are you like the painting of a sorrow, a face without a heart? laertes. why ask you this? king. not that i think you did not love your father, but that i know love is begun by time, and that i see, in passages of proof, time qualifies the spark and fire of it. there lives within the very flame of love a kind of wick or snuff that will abate it and nothing is at a like goodness still, for goodness, growing to a pleurisy, dies in his own too much. that we would do, we should do when we would for this would changes, and hath abatements and delays as many as there are tongues, are hands, are accidents and then this should is like a spendthrift sigh that hurts by easing. but to the quick o thulcer hamlet comes back what would you undertake to show yourself your fathers son in deed, more than in words? laertes. to cut his throat i th church. king. no place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize revenge should have no bounds. but good laertes, will you do this, keep close within your chamber. hamlet returnd shall know you are come home well put on those shall praise your excellence, and set a double varnish on the fame the frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together and wager on your heads. he, being remiss, most generous, and free from all contriving, will not peruse the foils so that with ease, or with a little shuffling, you may choose a sword unbated, and in a pass of practice, requite him for your father. laertes. i will dot. and for that purpose ill anoint my sword. i bought an unction of a mountebank so mortal that, but dip a knife in it, where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon, can save the thing from death this is but scratchd withal. ill touch my point with this contagion, that if i gall him slightly, it may be death. king. lets further think of this, weigh what convenience both of time and means may fit us to our shape. if this should fail, and that our drift look through our bad performance. twere better not assayd. therefore this project should have a back or second, that might hold if this did blast in proof. soft, let me see. well make a solemn wager on your cunnings, i hat! when in your motion you are hot and dry, as make your bouts more violent to that end, and that he calls for drink, ill have prepard him a chalice for the nonce whereon but sipping, if he by chance escape your venomd stuck, our purpose may hold there. enter queen. how now, sweet queen? queen. one woe doth tread upon anothers heel, so fast they follow. your sisters drownd, laertes. laertes. drownd! o, where? queen. there is a willow grows aslant a brook, that shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream. there with fantastic garlands did she make of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples, that liberal shepherds give a grosser name, but our cold maids do dead mens fingers call them. there on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds clambring to hang, an envious sliver broke, when down her weedy trophies and herself fell in the weeping brook. her clothes spread wide, and mermaidlike, awhile they bore her up, which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes, as one incapable of her own distress, or like a creature native and indued unto that element. but long it could not be till that her garments, heavy with their drink, pulld the poor wretch from her melodious lay to muddy death. laertes. alas, then she is drownd? queen. drownd, drownd. laertes. too much of water hast thou, poor ophelia, and therefore i forbid my tears. but yet it is our trick nature her custom holds, let shame say what it will. when these are gone, the woman will be out. adieu, my lord, i have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze, but that this folly douts it.  king. lets follow, gertrude how much i had to do to calm his rage! now fear i this will give it start again therefore lets follow.  act v scene i. a churchyard. enter two clowns with spades, c. first clown. is she to be buried in christian burial, when she wilfully seeks her own salvation? second clown. i tell thee she is, and therefore make her grave straight. the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it christian burial. first clown. how can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence? second clown. why, tis found so. first clown. it must be se offendendo, it cannot be else. for here lies the point if i drown myself wittingly, it argues an act and an act hath three branches. it is to act, to do, and to perform argal, she drowned herself wittingly. second clown. nay, but hear you, goodman delver, first clown. give me leave. here lies the water good. here stands the man good. if the man go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he nill he, he goes,mark you that. but if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself. argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life. second clown. but is this law? first clown. ay, marry, ist, crowners quest law. second clown. will you ha the truth ont? if this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o christian burial. first clown. why, there thou sayst. and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even christian. come, my spade. there is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and gravemakers they hold up adams profession. second clown. was he a gentleman? first clown. he was the first that ever bore arms. second clown. why, he had none. first clown. what, art a heathen? how dost thou understand the scripture? the scripture says adam diggd. could he dig without arms? ill put another question to thee. if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself second clown. go to. first clown. what is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter? second clown. the gallowsmaker for that frame outlives a thousand tenants. first clown. i like thy wit well in good faith, the gallows does well. but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill. now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church argal, the gallows may do well to thee. tot again, come. second clown. who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter? first clown. ay, tell me that, and unyoke. second clown. marry, now i can tell. first clown. tot. second clown. mass, i cannot tell. enter hamlet and horatio, at a distance. first clown. cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating and when you are asked this question next, say a gravemaker. the houses he makes last till doomsday. go, get thee to yaughan fetch me a stoup of liquor.   in youth when i did love, did love, methought it was very sweet to contract, o, the time for, a, my behove, o methought there was nothing meet. hamlet. has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at gravemaking? horatio. custom hath made it in him a property of easiness. hamlet. tis een so the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense. first clown.  but age with his stealing steps hath clawd me in his clutch, and hath shippd me into the land, as if i had never been such.  hamlet. that skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. how the knave jowls it to th ground, as if twere cains jawbone, that did the first murder! this might be the pate of a politician which this ass now oeroffices, one that would circumvent god, might it not? horatio. it might, my lord. hamlet. or of a courtier, which could say good morrow, sweet lord! how dost thou, good lord? this might be my lord suchaone, that praised my lord suchaones horse when he meant to beg it, might it not? horatio. ay, my lord. hamlet. why, een so and now my lady worms chapless, and knocked about the mazard with a sextons spade. heres fine revolution, an we had the trick to seet. did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with em?

where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? hum. this fellow might be ins time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? the very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha? horatio. not a jot more, my lord. hamlet. is not parchment made of sheepskins? horatio. ay, my lord, and of calfskins too. hamlet. they are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. i will speak to this fellow.whose graves this, sir?

first clown. of all the days i th year, i came tot that day that our last king hamlet oercame fortinbras. hamlet. how long is that since? first clown. cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that. it was the very day that young hamlet was born,he that is mad, and sent into england. hamlet. ay, marry, why was he sent into england? first clown. why, because he was mad he shall recover his wits there or if he do not, its no great matter there. hamlet. why? first clown. twill not be seen in him there there the men are as mad as he. hamlet. how came he mad? first clown. very strangely, they say. hamlet. how strangely? first clown. faith, een with losing his wits. hamlet. upon what ground? first clown. why, here in denmark. i have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years. hamlet. how long will a man lie i thearth ere he rot?

first clown. een that. hamlet. let me see.  alas, poor yorick. i knew him, horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. he hath borne me on his back a thousand times and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. here hung those lips that i have kissd i know not how oft. where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chopfallen? now get you to my ladys chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come. make her laugh at that.prithee, horatio, tell me one thing. horatio. whats that, my lord? hamlet. dost thou think alexander looked o this fashion i thearth? horatio. een so. hamlet. and smelt so? pah!  horatio. een so, my lord. hamlet. to what base uses we may return, horatio! why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole? horatio. twere to consider too curiously to consider so. hamlet. no, faith, not a jot. but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it as thus. alexander died, alexander was buried, alexander returneth into dust the dust is earth of earth we make loam and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beerbarrel? imperious caesar, dead and turnd to clay, might stop a hole to keep the wind away. o, that that earth which kept the world in awe should patch a wall texpel the winters flaw. but soft! but soft! aside! here comes the king. enter priests, c, in procession the corpse of ophelia, laertes and mourners following king, queen, their trains, c. the queen, the courtiers. who is that they follow? and with such maimed rites? this doth betoken the corse they follow did with desperate hand fordo it own life. twas of some estate. couch we awhile and mark.  laertes. what ceremony else? hamlet. that is laertes, a very noble youth. mark. laertes. what ceremony else? priest. her obsequies have been as far enlargd as we have warranties. her death was doubtful and but that great command oersways the order, she should in ground unsanctified have lodgd till the last trumpet. for charitable prayers, shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her. yet here she is allowed her virgin rites, her maiden strewments, and the bringing home of bell and burial. laertes. must there no more be done? priest. no more be done. we should profane the service of the dead to sing sage requiem and such rest to her as to peaceparted souls. laertes. lay her i thearth, and from her fair and unpolluted flesh may violets spring. i tell thee, churlish priest, a ministring angel shall my sister be when thou liest howling. hamlet. what, the fair ophelia? queen.  sweets to the sweet. farewell. i hopd thou shouldst have been my hamlets wife i thought thy bridebed to have deckd, sweet maid, and not have strewd thy grave. laertes. o, treble woe fall ten times treble on that cursed head whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense deprivd thee of. hold off the earth a while, till i have caught her once more in mine arms.  now pile your dust upon the quick and dead, till of this flat a mountain you have made, to oertop old pelion or the skyish head of blue olympus. hamlet.  what is he whose grief bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow conjures the wandring stars, and makes them stand like wonderwounded hearers? this is i, hamlet the dane.  laertes.  the devil take thy soul! hamlet. thou prayst not well. i prithee take thy fingers from my throat for though i am not splenative and rash, yet have i in me something dangerous, which let thy wiseness fear. away thy hand! king. pluck them asunder. queen. hamlet! hamlet! all. gentlemen! horatio. good my lord, be quiet.  hamlet. why, i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag. queen. o my son, what theme? hamlet. i lovd ophelia forty thousand brothers could not, with all their quantity of love, make up my sum. what wilt thou do for her? king. o, he is mad, laertes. queen. for love of god forbear him! hamlet. swounds, show me what thoult do woult weep? woult fight? woult fast? woult tear thyself? woult drink up eisel? eat a crocodile? ill dot. dost thou come here to whine? to outface me with leaping in her grave? be buried quick with her, and so will i. and if thou prate of mountains, let them throw millions of acres on us, till our ground, singeing his pate against the burning zone, make ossa like a wart. nay, an thoult mouth, ill rant as well as thou. queen. this is mere madness and thus awhile the fit will work on him anon, as patient as the female dove, when that her golden couplets are disclosd, his silence will sit drooping. hamlet. hear you, sir what is the reason that you use me thus? i lovd you ever. but it is no matter. let hercules himself do what he may, the cat will mew, and dog will have his day.  king. i pray thee, good horatio, wait upon him.   strengthen your patience in our last nights speech well put the matter to the present push. good gertrude, set some watch over your son. this grave shall have a living monument. an hour of quiet shortly shall we see till then in patience our proceeding be.  scene ii. a hall in the castle. enter hamlet and horatio. hamlet. so much for this, sir. now let me see the other you do remember all the circumstance? horatio. remember it, my lord! hamlet. sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting that would not let me sleep. methought i lay worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. rashly, and praisd be rashness for it,let us know, our indiscretion sometime serves us well, when our deep plots do pall and that should teach us theres a divinity that shapes our ends, roughhew them how we will. horatio. that is most certain. hamlet. up from my cabin, my seagown scarfd about me, in the dark gropd i to find out them had my desire, fingerd their packet, and in fine, withdrew to mine own room again, making so bold, my fears forgetting manners, to unseal their grand commission where i found, horatio, oh royal knavery! an exact command, larded with many several sorts of reasons, importing denmarks health, and englands too, with ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, that on the supervise, no leisure bated, no, not to stay the grinding of the axe, my head should be struck off. horatio. ist possible? hamlet. heres the commission, read it at more leisure. but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed? horatio. i beseech you. hamlet. being thus benetted round with villanies, or i could make a prologue to my brains, they had begun the play,i sat me down, devisd a new commission, wrote it fair i once did hold it, as our statists do, a baseness to write fair, and labourd much how to forget that learning but, sir, now it did me yeomans service. wilt thou know the effect of what i wrote? horatio. ay, good my lord. hamlet. an earnest conjuration from the king, as england was his faithful tributary, as love between them like the palm might flourish, as peace should still her wheaten garland wear and stand a comma tween their amities, and many suchlike ases of great charge, that on the view and know of these contents, without debatement further, more or less, he should the bearers put to sudden death, not shrivingtime allowd. horatio. how was this seald? hamlet. why, even in that was heaven ordinant. i had my fathers signet in my purse, which was the model of that danish seal folded the writ up in the form of the other, subscribd it gavet thimpression placd it safely, the changeling never known. now, the next day was our seafight, and what to this was sequent thou knowst already. horatio. so guildenstern and rosencrantz go tot. hamlet. why, man, they did make love to this employment. they are not near my conscience their defeat does by their own insinuation grow. tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites. horatio. why, what a king is this! hamlet. does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now upon, he that hath killd my king, and whord my mother, poppd in between thelection and my hopes, thrown out his angle for my proper life, and with such cozenageist not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm? and ist not to be damnd to let this canker of our nature come in further evil? horatio. it must be shortly known to him from england what is the issue of the business there. hamlet. it will be short. the interim is mine and a mans lifes no more than to say one. but i am very sorry, good horatio, that to laertes i forgot myself for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his. ill court his favours. but sure the bravery of his grief did put me into a towring passion. horatio. peace, who comes here? enter osric. osric. your lordship is right welcome back to denmark. hamlet. i humbly thank you, sir. dost know this waterfly? horatio. no, my good lord. hamlet. thy state is the more gracious for tis a vice to know him. he hath much land, and fertile let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the kings mess tis a chough but, as i say, spacious in the possession of dirt. osric. sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, i should impart a thing to you from his majesty. hamlet. i will receive it with all diligence of spirit. put your bonnet to his right use tis for the head. osric. i thank your lordship, tis very hot. hamlet. no, believe me, tis very cold, the wind is northerly. osric. it is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed. hamlet. methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion. osric. exceedingly, my lord it is very sultry,as twerei cannot tell how. but, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head. sir, this is the matter, hamlet. i beseech you, remember,  osric. nay, in good faith for mine ease, in good faith. sir, here is newly come to court laertes believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing. indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see. hamlet. sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though i know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy tharithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. but, in the verity of extolment, i take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage, nothing more. osric. your lordship speaks most infallibly of him. hamlet. the concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath? osric. sir? horatio. ist not possible to understand in another tongue? you will dot, sir, really. hamlet. what imports the nomination of this gentleman? osric. of laertes? horatio. his purse is empty already, alls golden words are spent. hamlet. of him, sir. osric. i know you are not ignorant, hamlet. i would you did, sir yet in faith if you did, it would not much approve me. well, sir? osric. you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is, hamlet. i dare not confess that, lest i should compare with him in excellence but to know a man well were to know himself. osric. i mean, sir, for his weapon but in the imputation laid on him, by them in his meed hes unfellowed. hamlet. whats his weapon? osric. rapier and dagger. hamlet. thats two of his weapons. but well. osric. the king, sir, hath wagerd with him six barbary horses, against the which he has imponed, as i take it, six french rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit. hamlet. what call you the carriages? horatio. i knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done. osric. the carriages, sir, are the hangers. hamlet. the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides. i would it might be hangers till then. but on. six barbary horses against six french swords, their assigns, and three liberal conceited carriages thats the french bet against the danish. why is this all imponed, as you call it? osric. the king, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him, he shall not exceed you three hits. he hath laid on twelve for nine. and it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
