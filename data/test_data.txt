hamlet. how if i answer no? osric. i mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial. hamlet. sir, i will walk here in the hall. if it please his majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, i will win for him if i can if not, i will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits. osric. shall i redeliver you een so? hamlet. to this effect, sir after what flourish your nature will. osric. i commend my duty to your lordship. hamlet. yours, yours.  he does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else fors turn. horatio. this lapwing runs away with the shell on his head. hamlet. he did comply with his dug before he suckd it. thus has he,and many more of the same bevy that i know the drossy age dotes on, only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yeasty collection, which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out. enter a lord. lord. my lord, his majesty commended him to you by young osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall. he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with laertes or that you will take longer time. hamlet. i am constant to my purposes, they follow the kings pleasure. if his fitness speaks, mine is ready. now or whensoever, provided i be so able as now. lord. the king and queen and all are coming down. hamlet. in happy time. lord. the queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to laertes before you fall to play. hamlet. she well instructs me.  horatio. you will lose this wager, my lord. hamlet. i do not think so. since he went into france, i have been in continual practice. i shall win at the odds. but thou wouldst not think how ill alls here about my heart but it is no matter. horatio. nay, good my lord. hamlet. it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving as would perhaps trouble a woman. horatio. if your mind dislike anything, obey it. i will forestall their repair hither, and say you are not fit. hamlet. not a whit, we defy augury. theres a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. if it be now, tis not to come if it be not to come, it will be now if it be not now, yet it will come. the readiness is all. since no man has aught of what he leaves, what ist to leave betimes? enter king, queen, laertes, lords, osric and attendants with foils c. king. come, hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.  hamlet. give me your pardon, sir. i have done you wrong but pardont as you are a gentleman. this presence knows, and you must needs have heard, how i am punishd with sore distraction. what i have done that might your nature, honour, and exception roughly awake, i here proclaim was madness. wast hamlet wrongd laertes? never hamlet. if hamlet from himself be taen away, and when hes not himself does wrong laertes, then hamlet does it not, hamlet denies it. who does it, then? his madness. ift be so, hamlet is of the faction that is wrongd his madness is poor hamlets enemy. sir, in this audience, let my disclaiming from a purposd evil free me so far in your most generous thoughts that i have shot my arrow oer the house and hurt my brother. laertes. i am satisfied in nature, whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge. but in my terms of honour i stand aloof, and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters of known honour i have a voice and precedent of peace to keep my name ungord. but till that time i do receive your offerd love like love, and will not wrong it. hamlet. i embrace it freely, and will this brothers wager frankly play. give us the foils come on. laertes. come, one for me. hamlet. ill be your foil, laertes in mine ignorance your skill shall like a star i th darkest night, stick fiery off indeed. laertes. you mock me, sir. hamlet. no, by this hand. king. give them the foils, young osric. cousin hamlet, you know the wager? hamlet. very well, my lord. your grace has laid the odds o the weaker side. king. i do not fear it. i have seen you both but since he is betterd, we have therefore odds. laertes. this is too heavy. let me see another. hamlet. this likes me well. these foils have all a length?  osric. ay, my good lord. king. set me the stoups of wine upon that table. if hamlet give the first or second hit, or quit in answer of the third exchange, let all the battlements their ordnance fire the king shall drink to hamlets better breath, and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmarks crown have worn. give me the cups and let the kettle to the trumpet speak, the trumpet to the cannoneer without, the cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth, now the king drinks to hamlet. come, begin. and you, the judges, bear a wary eye. hamlet. come on, sir. laertes. come, my lord.  hamlet. one. laertes. no. hamlet. judgement. osric. a hit, a very palpable hit. laertes. well again. king. stay, give me drink. hamlet, this pearl is thine heres to thy health.  give him the cup. hamlet. ill play this bout first set it by awhile.  come. another hit what say you? laertes. a touch, a touch, i do confess. king. our son shall win. queen. hes fat, and scant of breath. here, hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows. the queen carouses to thy fortune, hamlet. hamlet. good madam. king. gertrude, do not drink. queen. i will, my lord i pray you pardon me. king.  it is the poisond cup it is too late. hamlet. i dare not drink yet, madam. by and by. queen. come, let me wipe thy face. laertes. my lord, ill hit him now. king. i do not thinkt. laertes.  and yet tis almost gainst my conscience. hamlet. come for the third, laertes. you do but dally. i pray you pass with your best violence. i am afeard you make a wanton of me. laertes. say you so? come on.  osric. nothing neither way. laertes. have at you now.  king. part them they are incensd. hamlet. nay, come again!  osric. look to the queen there, ho! horatio. they bleed on both sides. how is it, my lord? osric. how ist, laertes? laertes. why, as a woodcock to my own springe, osric. i am justly killd with mine own treachery. hamlet. how does the queen? king. she swoons to see them bleed. queen. no, no, the drink, the drink! o my dear hamlet! the drink, the drink! i am poisond.  hamlet. o villany! ho! let the door be lockd treachery! seek it out.  laertes. it is here, hamlet. hamlet, thou art slain. no medicine in the world can do thee good. in thee there is not half an hour of life the treacherous instrument is in thy hand, unbated and envenomd. the foul practice hath turnd itself on me. lo, here i lie, never to rise again. thy mothers poisond. i can no more. the king, the kings to blame. hamlet. the point envenomd too! then, venom, to thy work.  osric and lords. treason! treason! king. o yet defend me, friends. i am but hurt. hamlet. here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned dane, drink off this potion. is thy union here? follow my mother.  laertes. he is justly servd. it is a poison temperd by himself. exchange forgiveness with me, noble hamlet. mine and my fathers death come not upon thee, nor thine on me.  hamlet. heaven make thee free of it! i follow thee. i am dead, horatio. wretched queen, adieu. you that look pale and tremble at this chance, that are but mutes or audience to this act, had i but time,as this fell sergeant, death, is strict in his arrest,o, i could tell you, but let it be. horatio, i am dead, thou livst report me and my cause aright to the unsatisfied. horatio. never believe it. i am more an antique roman than a dane. heres yet some liquor left. hamlet. as thart a man, give me the cup. let go by heaven, ill havet. o good horatio, what a wounded name, things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me. if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, absent thee from felicity awhile, and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, to tell my story.  what warlike noise is this? osric. young fortinbras, with conquest come from poland, to the ambassadors of england gives this warlike volley. hamlet. o, i die, horatio. the potent poison quite oercrows my spirit i cannot live to hear the news from england, but i do prophesy thelection lights on fortinbras. he has my dying voice. so tell him, with the occurrents more and less, which have solicited. the rest is silence.  horatio. now cracks a noble heart. good night, sweet prince, and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest. why does the drum come hither?  enter fortinbras, the english ambassadors and others. fortinbras. where is this sight? horatio. what is it you would see? if aught of woe or wonder, cease your search. fortinbras. this quarry cries on havoc. o proud death, what feast is toward in thine eternal cell, that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck? first ambassador. the sight is dismal and our affairs from england come too late. the ears are senseless that should give us hearing, to tell him his commandment is fulfilld, that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead. where should we have our thanks? horatio. not from his mouth, had it thability of life to thank you. he never gave commandment for their death. but since, so jump upon this bloody question, you from the polack wars, and you from england are here arrivd, give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view, and let me speak to th yet unknowing world how these things came about. so shall you hear of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts, of accidental judgements, casual slaughters, of deaths put on by cunning and forcd cause, and, in this upshot, purposes mistook falln on the inventors heads. all this can i truly deliver. fortinbras. let us haste to hear it, and call the noblest to the audience. for me, with sorrow i embrace my fortune. i have some rights of memory in this kingdom, which now to claim my vantage doth invite me. horatio. of that i shall have also cause to speak, and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more. but let this same be presently performd, even while mens minds are wild, lest more mischance on plots and errors happen. fortinbras. let four captains bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage, for he was likely, had he been put on, to have provd most royally and for his passage, the soldiers music and the rites of war speak loudly for him. take up the bodies. such a sight as this becomes the field, but here shows much amiss. go, bid the soldiers shoot.    end of the
